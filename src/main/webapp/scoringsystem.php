		<ul>
			<li>Clearing 1 Line at once, gives You 100 points + 5 x the current level</li>
			<li>Clearing 2 Line at once, gives You 400 points + 20 x the current level</li>
			<li>Clearing 3 Line at once, gives You 900 points + 45 x the current level</li>
			<li>Clearing 4 Line at once, gives You 1600 points + 80 x the current level</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>For example:</h2>
		<p>The current level is 20 (the highest level) and You clear 4 Lines at once, then You get 1600 + 80 x 20 = 2 x 1600 = 3200. on level 20 you are making twice as much points as on level 0.</p>
